# Midudev & RapidApi Hackathon 💻

Created for [Midudev](https://midu.dev/)'s hackathon in collaboration with [Rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/hub), using [WeatherAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com/weatherapi/api/weatherapi-com/) API.

## About 🤓

<img src="https://github.com/judithmg/weather-app-rapiapi/blob/main/public/mobb.png?raw=true"/>

This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)'s build tool, using `react` with `TypeScript`. It was deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

The app is responsive, with two different views (mobile and deskptop). 

* Click on hamburger menu to see previous searches. They'll be saved in `localStorage` thanks to `zustand`'s `persist` middleware.
* Search for any city using `RapidApi`'s API
* You'll be able to check today's weather, as well as 3 days' forecast!
* Chart created with `react-chartjs-2` showing today's temperature
* See today's temperature hourly

Test environment was set but due to lack of time, not many tests were written.
